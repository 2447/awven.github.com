{"name":"Light Blog","tagline":"A super light Markdown based blog","body":"lightblog\r\n=========\r\n\r\nWhy use light blog over Wordpress or Drupal?\r\n1. It's simple\r\n2. It doesn't need a database\r\n4. It's lightweight\r\n5. No installation required, just drag and drop files\r\n\r\nInstallation in 10 simple steps\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. First of all get yourself a copy of the files by clicking [here (.zip)](https://github.com/SiteOctopus/Light-Blog/zipball/master) or by git cloning\r\n\r\n2. Now you need to install the whole folder onto your *linux* webserver.\r\n3. Make sure that there's a file called `.htaccess`. If not create one containing this code:\r\n```\r\nRewriteEngine On\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\r\nRewriteCond $1 !^(index\\.php)\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Now open `app/config.ini` in your favourite text editor. Change the `site.url` variable to the location of index.php. For example: `http://example.com` or `http://example.com/folder/`. Just remember to include a trailing slash\r\n\r\n5. Change the blog info to match your blog. Now save the file back onto your webserver\r\n\r\n6. Now open `app/views/layout.html.php`. You'll see some HTML code. Between the code `<!-- the sidebar-->` and `<!--End custom sidebar-->` you can add whatever you want. We've put a `<ul>` list in for you, but you can have anything!\r\n\r\n7. Now create you first post using Markdown. The syntax help is [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). You *must* begin your document with \r\n`#Title here`\r\notherwise it won't work!\r\n\r\n8. Call your file:\r\n\tYYYY-MM-DD_a-title.md\r\n9. Now refresh the page\r\n10. Your blog is complete!\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\nMaking light blog wouldn't have been possible without (in no particular order...)\r\n* [PHP Markdown](https://github.com/dflydev/dflydev-markdown)\r\n* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)\r\n* [PHP RSS Writer](https://github.com/suin/php-rss-writer)\r\n* [Dispatch](http://noodlehaus.github.com/dispatch/)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_GB\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons Licence\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_GB\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
